# Font Contrast

Simple add-on to improve legibility on hard to read websites. Allows you to turn all or non-grey text to black, to dim to a darker shade of the same color (e.g. light grey to dark grey), or to increase 
the size of fonts below a certain threshold. It does so using no JS on the page contents, but rather a simple <style> element.
